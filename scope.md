# First Project Scope:

Analyze all reddit content during the ramp up of Rastakhan's Rumble expansion.

This will include all posts from 11/1/18 (day before announcement) to end of day 12/9/18 (the weekend after release).

### Goals:
- Analyze sentiment during release events.
- Attempt to determine if there are any influencers at work during this time.
  - Track all posters' information throughout the time frame and their associated meta data.

### Caveats:

Data will be retrospective meaning that upvote patterns will not be able to factor in analysis.
